### About Me
*******
I am 24 years old, currently I work as a layout designer. I studied independently at various marathons, since at one time I was interested in this profession more as a hobby and self-development. But after a while I had the opportunity to work in this direction. 
Now I want to grow in this direction and move to the level of front-end developer. Last year I already tried to take a similar course from rs-school, but at a higher level, but without knowing the basics it was difficult, so I had to interrupt my studies and I decided that I would definitely sign up for the Pre-School course.
* #### My strengths:
  + Fast learning
  + Easy team work
  + Diligence
  + Good communication skills

    		     splitStringArray[i]=splitStringArray[i].split("").reverse().join("");
    	}
    }
    let joinString = splitStringArray.join(" ");
